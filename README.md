# API Integration

## Lab problem
In this final phase, weâ€™ll be requiring that users be logged in through a live authentication server, in order to see the to do items. Additionally, based on their user type, they will be allowed (or denied) to perform actions such as editing or deleting them. All To Do items will be stored in a database, accessed through a deployed API

## Tests
To rub tests type "npm test todo-app-api"
